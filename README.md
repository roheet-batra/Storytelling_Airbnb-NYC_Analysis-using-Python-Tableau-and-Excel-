## <font color = Green > Problem Statement </font>

Suppose that you are working as a data analyst at Airbnb. For the past few months, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue. Now that the restrictions have started lifting and people have started to travel more, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.

## <font color = Green > Business Goal </font>

The different leaders at Airbnb want to understand some important insights based on various attributes in the dataset so as to increase the revenue such as -

1. Which type of hosts to acquire more and where?
2. The categorisation of customers based on their preferences.
    - What are the neighbourhoods they need to target?
    - What is the pricing ranges preferred by customers?
    - The various kinds of properties that exist w.r.t. customer preferences.
    - Adjustments in the existing properties to make it more customer-oriented.
3. What are the most popular localities and properties in New York currently?
4. How to get unpopular properties more traction? and so on...

## <font color = Green > Objectives </font>

To prepare for the next best steps that Airbnb needs to take as a business, you have been asked to analyse a dataset consisting of various Airbnb listings in New York. Based on this analysis, you need to give two presentations to the following groups.

1. Presentation - I
+ **Data Analysis Managers:** These people manage the data analysts directly for processes and their technical expertise is basic.
+ **Lead Data Analyst:** The lead data analyst looks after the entire team of data and business analysts and is technically sound.

2. Presentation - II
+ **Head of Acquisitions and Operations, NYC:** This head looks after all the property and host acquisitions and operations. Acquisition of the best properties, price negotiation, and negotiating the services the properties offer falls under the purview of this role.
+ **Head of User Experience, NYC:** The head of user experience looks after the customer preferences and also handles the properties listed on the website and the Airbnb app. Basically, the head of user experience tries to optimise the order of property listing in certain neighbourhoods and cities in order to get every property the optimal amount of traction.

+ Although this is a storytelling exercise meaning that the tasks performed on the data are not important for the end objective, **there is a methodology document that you need to submit**. This document should ideally contain the entire methodology, technical details, and assumptions wherever applicable. This document is also necessary to verify all the steps you have performed to arrive at the final presentations and hence without it, your presentations will not be graded.
+ Once you are done with the analysis and visualisations, there will be many insights at your hand. Make sure that you map the right visuals and takeaways with the right audience since some of these insights might be relevant to one group but not to the other group

## <font color = Green > Steps Followed </font>

+ **Data Understanding, Preparation, and Pre-Processing :**
     - Data understanding, identification of potentially useful and non-useful attributes and variable importance and impact estimation
     - Data preparation, performing data cleaning, missing values imputation, outlier removal, and column level standardization (for e.g., date, etc.) into one format
     
+ **Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation :**
     - Feature engineering and performing one or more methods on attributes that can lead to the creation of a new potentially useful variable; for e.g., day from the date
     - Variable transformation and applying categorical variable transformations to turn into numerical data and numerical variable transformations to scale data
 
+ **Exploratory Data Analysis :**
     - Performing basic preliminary data analysis including finding the correlation between variables and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables
     - Performing advanced data analysis, including plotting relevant heatmaps, histograms, and basic clustering to find patterns in the data
